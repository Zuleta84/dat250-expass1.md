My experience installing the programs recommended by the teachers was very interesting, not only because I learned new things but also because I began to better understand how to use these tools / programs to develop projects.
Through the Windows cmd I was able to verify that Maven and other applications were installed correctly.
Maven took some time but developing the herouko tutorial was what took me the most, since when I applied (heroku create)  in git, I had problems with the heoruko version since it warned me that I had to update.
When I finally realized that I had to log in to my heroku account to be able to continue in git
The problem is that I couldn't update heroku from git and I still can't do it and not if this is what caused that I couldn't develop the application as expected. I tried to see where my Git repository was located but I couldn't understand what the dialog showed me.
I am working for to get the aplication deplyed as a expected but i have to read an resaerch more about Heroku.
